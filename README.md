Tools for brain farts. With music. And noise fantasy &copy;.

## [Live tools](https://victorzinho.github.io/brain-fartools/)


## Java tools

  - [Hex grid harmony](src/main/java/victorzinho/music/usecases/atyla).
  - [Points in a raster](src/main/java/victorzinho/music/usecases/raster).


## Description 

These are tools I've used in the past to create and/or analyze music, from simulating a ball bouncing on the floor to
generating random notes or automatically produce chord progressions with certain "color" (Ã  la Vivier). 

I'm half GIS (software) engineer, half musician (percentages may vary). If you're an engineer (or someone looking to
hire me as an engineer :wink:), code is definitely not the best I've ever written. It works for me since I'm just having
some fun while making my composition process easier (with JS which I don't normally use). Copy-paste/reuse this
garbage at your own risk.
